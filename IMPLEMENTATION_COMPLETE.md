# Game Prize - Password Protection Complete!

**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED
**Date:** 22 Ottobre 2025
**Time:** Implementation Complete

---

## What Was Done

Your Game Prize system is now **COMPLETELY HIDDEN** behind a password protection system. Nobody can discover or access any Game Prize content without entering the correct password.

---

## Password Protection Summary

### The Password
```
The Game
```

This password is the ONLY way to access:
- Game Prize countdown on home page
- Game Prize icon in your private dashboard
- All admin setup and configuration pages
- Game Prize leaderboard and statistics

### What's Hidden
- ✓ Countdown timer (hidden until authenticated)
- ✓ Game Prize section on home page (hidden until authenticated)
- ✓ Game Prize icon in dashboard (hidden until authenticated)
- ✓ Admin welcome page (protected by password decorator)
- ✓ Admin setup page (protected by password decorator)
- ✓ Admin dashboard (protected by password decorator)
- ✓ All challenge management pages (protected by password decorator)
- ✓ All clue management pages (protected by password decorator)

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Routes Added
- `POST /verify-game-password` - Validates password and sets session
- `GET /logout-game-admin` - Clears authentication and logs out

### 2. Decorator Added
- `@game_prize_password_required` - Applied to all 6 admin routes
  - `/game-prize/admin/welcome`
  - `/game-prize/admin/setup`
  - `/game-prize/admin/dashboard`
  - `/game-prize/admin/challenge/add`
  - `/game-prize/admin/challenge/<id>/edit`
  - `/game-prize/admin/clue/add/<id>`

### 3. Session Management
- Session variable: `session['game_admin_authenticated']`
- Persists until user clicks "Esci" or closes browser
- Checked on every page render via context processor

### 4. Frontend Protection
- Home page conditionally shows password form or countdown
- Dashboard conditionally shows Game Prize icon
- All unauthenticated users see "Accesso Protetto" message

### 5. Files Modified
- ✓ `app.py` - Added routes and context processor
- ✓ `templates/home.html` - Added password gate and conditional rendering
- ✓ `templates/dashboard.html` - Added conditional Game Prize icon
- ✓ `modules/game_prize.py` - Added decorator and applied to routes

## Flash Messages

The system provides clear feedback:
- ✓ "Accesso concesso al Game Prize!" - Password correct
- ✓ "Password non corretta. Riprova." - Wrong password
- ✓ "Sei stato disconnesso dal Game Prize." - Logged out
- ✓ "Accesso negato. Il Game Prize è protetto da password." - Direct route access blocked

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Visits Home Page
```
GET / → Home page loads
↓
System checks: session.get('game_admin_authenticated', False)
↓
Result: False → Password form shown
```

### Step 2: User Enters Password
```
POST /verify-game-password
password="The Game"
↓
System validates: if password == "The Game"
↓
Sets: session['game_admin_authenticated'] = True
↓
Redirects to /
```

### Step 3: User Sees Countdown
```
GET / → Home page loads
↓
System checks: session.get('game_admin_authenticated')
↓
Result: True → Countdown section shown
```

### Step 4: User Logs Out
```
GET /logout-game-admin
↓
System deletes: del session['game_admin_authenticated']
↓
Redirects to /
↓
User sees password form again
```

## Security Details

**Session-Based Authentication**
- Authentication stored in Flask session (not in cookie)
- Lost when browser closes
- Can be manually cleared by logout button
- Reset on each new browser session

**Password Protection Levels**
- Level 1: Frontend password form on home page
- Level 2: Template conditionals hide content
- Level 3: Route decorators block direct access to admin pages

**Multiple Protection Layers**
```
Home Page           → Check: {% if game_admin_authenticated %}
Dashboard          → Check: {% if game_admin_authenticated %}
Admin Welcome      → Check: @game_prize_password_required
Admin Setup        → Check: @game_prize_password_required
Admin Dashboard    → Check: @game_prize_password_required
Challenge Pages    → Check: @game_prize_password_required
Clue Pages         → Check: @game_prize_password_required
```

---

## Removing Protection Later

When the Game Prize is ready to be revealed, simply:

1. Remove the password check from `home.html`:
   ```
   {% if game_admin_authenticated %} → Remove this
   ```

2. Remove decorators from `modules/game_prize.py`:
   ```
   @game_prize_password_required → Remove this
   ```

3. Remove routes from `app.py`:
   ```
   /verify-game-password → Remove this
   /logout-game-admin → Remove this
   ```

That's it! The countdown will be fully visible and public.
