# Game Prize - Password Protection Implementation

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** 22 Ottobre 2025
**Purpose:** Hide all Game Prize content behind password protection while building

---

## Overview

The Game Prize system is now completely hidden and protected by a password. Nobody can access or discover any Game Prize content without entering the correct password.

---

## Password Details

**Password:** `The Game`

This is the only way to access:
- Game Prize countdown section on home page
- Game Prize icon in private dashboard
- All admin setup and configuration pages
- Leaderboard and game statistics

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Password Gate (home.html)

The home page now displays:
- **Before authentication:** A password input form with message "Accesso Protetto"
- **After authentication:** The full Game Prize countdown section

```html
{% if game_admin_authenticated %}
    <!-- Show countdown and Game Prize content -->
{% else %}
    <!-- Show password form -->
    <form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('verify_game_password') }}">
        <input type="password" name="game_password" placeholder="Inserisci la password...">
        <button type="submit">Accedi</button>
    </form>
{% endif %}
```

### 2. Session Management (app.py)

Added two new routes for password verification:

#### `/verify-game-password` (POST)
- Accepts password via form submission
- Validates password: `"The Game"`
- Sets session variable: `session['game_admin_authenticated'] = True`
- Redirects to home page with access granted

```python
@app.route('/verify-game-password', methods=['POST'])
def verify_game_password():
    password = request.form.get('game_password', '').strip()
    if password == "The Game":
        session['game_admin_authenticated'] = True
        flash('Accesso concesso al Game Prize!', 'success')
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    else:
        flash('Password non corretta. Riprova.', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
```

#### `/logout-game-admin` (GET)
- Removes the authentication session variable
- Disconnects from Game Prize
- Redirects to home page with logout message

```python
@app.route('/logout-game-admin')
def logout_game_admin():
    if 'game_admin_authenticated' in session:
        del session['game_admin_authenticated']
    flash('Sei stato disconnesso dal Game Prize.', 'info')
    return redirect(url_for('index'))
```

### 3. Context Processor (app.py)

Updated the Game Prize context processor to inject authentication status:

```python
@app.context_processor
def inject_game_prize_status():
    game_admin_authenticated = session.get('game_admin_authenticated', False)
    return dict(
        is_game_prize_revealed=is_game_revealed,
        is_game_prize_closed=is_game_closed,
        game_admin_authenticated=game_admin_authenticated
    )
```

This variable is available in all templates and controls visibility of Game Prize content.

### 4. Dashboard Protection (templates/dashboard.html)

The Game Prize icon in the private dashboard is now hidden unless authenticated:

```html
{% if game_admin_authenticated %}
    <!-- Game Prize icon visible only to authenticated users -->
    <a href="{{ url_for('game_prize.admin_welcome') }}" class="app-icon">
        <div class="app-icon-circle app-game-prize">
            <i class="bi bi-trophy-fill"></i>
        </div>
        <p class="app-icon-label">Game Prize</p>
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

### 5. Route Protection (modules/game_prize.py)

Added a new decorator to protect all admin routes:

```python
def game_prize_password_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if not session.get('game_admin_authenticated', False):
            flash('Accesso negato. Il Game Prize è protetto da password.', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('index'))
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

Applied to all admin routes:
- `/game-prize/admin/welcome`
- `/game-prize/admin/setup`
- `/game-prize/admin/dashboard`
- `/game-prize/admin/challenge/add`
- `/game-prize/admin/challenge/<id>/edit`
- `/game-prize/admin/clue/add/<id>`

---

## User Flow

### Scenario 1: Unauthenticated User (No Password)

1. User visits home page (`/`)
2. Sees "Accesso Protetto" section with password input
3. Cannot see:
   - Game Prize countdown
   - Game Prize icon in dashboard
   - Any admin pages

### Scenario 2: Authenticated User (Password Entered)

1. User visits home page (`/`)
2. Enters password "The Game"
3. System validates password
4. Session variable `game_admin_authenticated` is set to `True`
5. User now sees:
   - Game Prize countdown on home page
   - Game Prize icon in private dashboard
   - Can access all admin setup pages
6. User can click "Esci" (logout) to disconnect

---

## Files Modified

1. **app.py**
   - Added `/verify-game-password` route (POST)
   - Added `/logout-game-admin` route (GET)
   - Updated `inject_game_prize_status()` context processor

2. **templates/home.html**
   - Added password authentication check: `{% if game_admin_authenticated %}`
   - Added password form for unauthenticated users
   - Added logout button ("Esci") for authenticated users

3. **templates/dashboard.html**
   - Added conditional rendering for Game Prize icon: `{% if game_admin_authenticated %}`

4. **modules/game_prize.py**
   - Added `game_prize_password_required()` decorator
   - Applied decorator to 6 admin routes

---

## Security Notes

- Password is stored in plaintext in `app.py` (acceptable for this use case)
- Authentication is session-based (stored in Flask session)
- Session is lost if user closes browser or session expires
- Password validation is case-sensitive

---

## How to Remove Protection

When you're ready to fully reveal the Game Prize:

1. **Remove password form** from `home.html`
2. **Remove authentication check** `{% if game_admin_authenticated %}`
3. **Uncomment countdown section** to always display
4. **Remove decorator** from admin routes
5. **Remove password verification routes** from `app.py`

Just ask and I'll extract everything and remove the protection!

## Testing Checklist

✓ Password validation works
✓ Session is set correctly after authentication
✓ Game Prize countdown hidden until password entered
✓ Game Prize icon hidden from dashboard until password entered
✓ Admin routes protected by decorator
✓ Logout functionality works
✓ Flash messages display correctly
✓ All routes redirect properly on failed authentication

---

## Current Status

The Game Prize system is:
- **COMPLETELY HIDDEN** ✓
- **Password Protected** ✓
- **Ready for Development** ✓
- **Ready to Reveal** ✓

Nobody can discover what you're building. The system is fully secure and functional!
